Team Edge Lab 14 Warm-up
========================

Remix this Glitch Project to do the following:
1. Create a new HTML submission page “submission.html” that loads when the submission button is clicked
2. Use the query selector within the lightMode() function so the light mode button does the following when clicked:
- Change the body background color to white
- Change the body text color to black
- Change the button text to say “Dark Mode”
